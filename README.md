## Get started

First of all, you need a [battle net developer account](https://develop.battle.net/).  
To make these calls work, it's not enough with client id and client secret, you need the access token.  
Easiest way to get this is to test a call on [their official site](https://develop.battle.net/documentation/world-of-warcraft-classic/game-data-apis)  
and pick up the access token from the request URL that's generated.
